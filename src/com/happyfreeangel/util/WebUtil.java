符合 javascript unescape 函数(支持Unicode)的 Java escape 编码实现
最近在弄一个跨域的交互程序,交互过程非常复杂.而且,其中一端只能使用 javascript 来处理返回. 

于是,发现 Java 的 URLEncoder.encode 方法与 JavaScript 的 unescape 方法已经不能兼容了. 

现在浏览器的主流版本中 JavaScript 已经开始使用 Unicode 作为字符串的内码进行编码.即, Unicode 字符 escape 之后的样子类似于 %uABCD 而 java 的 URLEncoder.encode 方法得到的结果是 %AB%CD ,转换出来的结果必定是乱码了. 

方法有两个,其一,用 Java 实现一个生成新编码的方法.其二,用 JavaScript 实现一个针对旧编码的解码方法.想了想,还是用 Java 要方便一点点吧. 

 

上次贴出的 escape 的 java 实现,似乎对大家有用.最近曾军同学提出 unescape 对于 javascript 与后端的交互也有意义.于是就一并实现了.再次贴上来. 

代码非常简单,注释就免了吧.一贯的,仍然遵循"以空间换时间"原则. 

需要的桶子,一贯的,help yourself.
